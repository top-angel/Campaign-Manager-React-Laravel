#CAMPAIGN MANAGER readme

**I can also include following features to make it a production ready app**
1. Enable soft delete
2. Resize the banners according to the display platform , for e.g. if the banner goes to actual google campaign I'll send the original one but to reduce the performance on our website or platform I can separate the banner into different sizes like thumbnail, compress image etc.
3. I can also make the react and laravel in single project but sometime apache routing does make issues with react routing it'll be better to make it two separate project
4. I can also use laravel's Auth scaffolding security to make it available to individual multiple users
